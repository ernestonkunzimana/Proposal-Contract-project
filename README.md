# Proposal-Contract-project
This repository contains a Solidity smart contract for a decentralized voting system. Owners can create and manage proposals with titles and descriptions, and users can vote to approve, reject, or pass. It tracks vote counts, prevents duplicate voting, and records proposal outcomes. Ideal for governance and feedback systems.
